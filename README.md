# The-ultimate-Stockholm-Gallery
Beetroot Academy - Intro to Tech

You'll be creating a minimalistic web page and view it in the browser!

DAY 1: [Start with cards]
● Add a title to your website. 
● Add your name or username under it. The font style should be bold.
● Add a Message Me link (Either your social network URL or pseudo URL);
● Make a Gallery Card;
● Add a title to each Gallery Card;
● Add a description;
● Add a image to each card;

DAY 2: [Add styling with CSS]
Now we can make our gallery good-looking! Here are some ideas to get you started (feel free to go beyond them):
● Change the Font Family of all the text elements. sans-serif or any custom font will do;
● A card's <div> should have a class name “card”;
● Each card's width should be 350px;
● Each image should fit into a card (hint: width: 100%);
● A card's title should be aligned to center;
● Each card should have some border and/or background color, and rounded corners;
● Change text color to one of your choice;
● Each card should have some padding (space between the border and inner content);
● Add some spacing between the card and the header;
● Add some spacing between the edges of the page and the page content (body tag);
● Any other styles you’d be willing to try (Explore CSS rules on the web).
  
DAY 3: [FlexBox]
● Display the cards as a row (not a column).
● Add some spacing between the cards; (hint: margin).
● Add a couple more cards with pictures;
● Display them in more than one row;
  
DAY 5: [Interactive]
 Lets make the page more interactive. Here are some of the styling properties to try out:
● Add a cursor: pointer; to the .card;
● Add a hover to your cards;
● Add a transition to zoom. Don't zoom the element immediately after you hover over it, rather zooms it little by little;
● Add some box-shadow around the card on hover so that it is highlighted visually. 

  Well done on creating your first web page!
